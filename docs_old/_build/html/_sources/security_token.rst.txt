Security Tokens
===============

Security tokens are a broad class of tokens used to represent digitally an asset or security as defined by a certain juristicion.
We dont claim to know every juristiction and its requirements, however a number of classes of security tokens can be build from components of the DutchSwap protocol.


Components
=========+
Full list of functions can be found in the Referrence docs. 

Partitions
==========
Different tranches or classes of shares can be represented by seperate tokens, mapped by the main DutchSwap contract.

Documents
=========
The main DutchSwap contract for each new venture comes built in with Documents

Distribution of Proceeds
========================
We have a dividend token type as part of the DutchSwap protocol

Transfer Restrictions
=====================
These requirements can be met by attaching token rules to either a base token or dividend token.
Different rules can be applied to each partion directly, with different partitions differernt juristictions or classes of holders. 
Time based functions within the token rule contracts also allow for token vesting or cooling off periods for certain transactions and conversions.
